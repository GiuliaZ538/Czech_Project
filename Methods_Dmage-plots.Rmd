## Script for R visualization of metaDMG output
#Packages

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(vegan)
library(rioja)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
